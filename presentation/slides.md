## The AI landscape has evolved a lot!

**Recently**: 

- DeepSeek opensourced R1
- Meta opensourced LLama3.2 and 3.3
- Microsoft Ph4
- OpenAI launched 03 mini
- Google Gemini 2.0
- and so much more...

<!-- 

### The AI landscape has evolved a lot!

- A lot has changed in the opensource and closed source AI world
- Recently:
    - DeepSeek R1: It's reasoning model and the made it completely open source, including how they build it!
    - LLama 3.2 and 3.2: Meta opensourced LLama 3.2 (small LLM's with 1 and 3B aparameters). Also the LLama 3.3 is opensourced which is a bigger brother with 70B parameters!
    - Microsoft Phi4: Microsoft opensourced it's state-of-the-art Phi4 model with 14B parameters
    - Open AI released a lot! o3 mini, o1, GPT 4o and a lot more cool stuff!
    - Google Gemini 2.0 which is faster and cheaper then everyone else!
    
## A lot more, but we don't have time for that!

## Local AI to the rescue

- Ollama: Developer friendly way to run opensource LLM's locally
- OpenWebUI: ChatGPT alternative which you can connect to Ollama
- LM Studio: More friendly for non-developers to run opensource LLM's via a GUI
- Continue.dev: IDE extension for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains to use multiple LLM's as AI coding assistant.
